We’re absolutely thrilled to introduce you to The Kindled Kettle. Our doors have just opened, and we’re ready to bring our passion for great food straight to your next event!

At The Kindled Kettle, we believe that food should be more than just a meal — it should be an experience that warms your heart and delights your senses. It shouldn’t be some deconstructed avant-garde piece. It should be something you can savor and enjoy. It should be capable of changing a good event into a legendary one. Whether you’re hosting an intimate gathering, planning a corporate event, or celebrating a milestone with a big bash, we’ve got you covered with our array of packages.

We are dedicated to making you food that you’ll want to bring home to your loved ones after any event. From our painstakingly-crafted BBQ, slow-cooked to perfection, to classic comfort foods that remind you of home, every bite is designed to satisfy, please, and inspire. We use only the highest quality ingredients and honed recipes to ensure each dish is packed with flavor and love.

But it’s not just about the food— we are here to make your event planning as easy and enjoyable as possible. We’ll work closely with you to understand your vision and handle every detail with care, so you can relax and savor the celebration. 

We invite you to explore our various packages and discover how we at The Kindled Kettle can add a touch of comfort and joy to your next event.
